# Playwright-Pytest Automation Exercise

This project uses Playwright and Pytest for automating tests on the web application **automationexercise.com**.

## üìÑ Description

This project automates testing for a web application using **Playwright** to control the browser and **Pytest** to execute tests.  
Tests can be run in headless mode using Python and Playwright, and results can be generated in both **HTML format** (for local viewing) and **Allure Report** (for more detailed insights).  
Additionally, this project includes integration with **Slack** to receive notifications about CI test results.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playwright-pytest-automationexercise.git
   cd playwright-pytest-automationexercise

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # for MacOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # for Windows

3. Install dependencies::
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## üöÄ Running Tests
- Running tests in headless mode:
    ```bash
    npm run test

- Running tests with Allure Report:
    ```bash
    npm run test_allure

- Generating Allure Report:
    ```bash
    npm run report_allure

- Serving Allure Report Locally:
    ```bash
    npm run serve_allure

- Running tests in headless mode with report (running tests in headless mode with a simple HTML report locally):
    ```bash
    npm run test_report

## Running Tests in Specific Browsers
- Run tests in Chromium:
    ```bash
    npm run test_chromium

- Run tests in Firefox:
    ```bash
    npm run test_firefox

- Run tests in WebKit:
    ```bash
    npm run test_webkit

All results are stored in allure-results, allowing later report generation.

## üî• Parallel Test Execution

- Before running parallel tests, ensure pytest-xdist is installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest-xdist

- Run Chromium tests in 2 parallel threads::
    ```bash
    npm run test_parallel_chromium

- Run Firefox tests in 2 parallel threads:
    ```bash
    npm run test_parallel_firefox

- Run WebKit tests in 2 parallel threads:
    ```bash
    npm run test_parallel_webkit

The number of parallel threads (-n X) can be adjusted based on machine performance.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Continuous Integration (CI) and Slack Notifications

This project uses GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on every push or pull request to the master branch.
After each CI run, a notification is sent to a configured Slack channel with the status of the run (success or failure) and a link to the published Allure report via GitHub Pages.

To configure Slack integration:

1. Create a Slack App and enable Incoming Webhooks.
2. Add a webhook URL to your Slack channel.
3. Save the webhook URL as a GitHub Actions Secret with the name ACTION_MONITORING_SLACK.

The Slack message includes:

- Repository name
- Workflow and job name
- Test status (‚úÖ success / ‚ùå failure)
- Run number
- Link to the latest published Allure report
